# Get started with Cloud Foundry and IBM Whitewater

### Continuously deliver a Cloud Foundry app with IBM Whitewater GHE

![Toolchain image](.bluemix/toolchain.png)

This template will configure a toolchain that can:
* perform rolling deploys through Bluemix stage1 (YS1) and then to Bluemix prod (YP).
* provide cognitive insights to learn where you most need to improve your developer productivity, code quality, and delivery cycle times; as well as provide quality gates that will stop a deploy that doesnâ€™t cut the mustard.
* track code deployments back to GHE commits and issues
* notify about delivery process in Slack
* allows to edit code online with WebIDE (but you can use desktop tools at your preference)

### To get started, click **Create toolchain**.
